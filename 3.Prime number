Check to see if it is a prime number - can be achieved in O(Log n) times


Prime number - 97 ===> Square root of n to see if there are any divisors for the given number 

Example : 7 

n/2 = 7/2 = < 2.5 

for each values of n from 1 to square root of n --> if it doesnt exist then it is a prime number


Example : 97 


97/2 = 49 

49/2 = 24 

24 /2 = 12 


12/2 = 6 --> Between 6 t0 12 --> divide all the factors to see if it exists..

Factors of a given number. 
-------------------------

           10
       1  2   5 10
       
       which is nothing but , it always comes in pairs 1,2 which pairs with 5 , 10 ========> 
       *** even number of factors 
       
       In case of perfect squares then 
       
            16
                 
       1  2 4 8 16  => 5 factors .Odd - only for perfect squares
       
    Based on this condition, to find a given number is prime - all we need is the first half of the factors to see if exists
