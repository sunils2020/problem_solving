Check to see if it is a prime number - can be achieved in O(Log n) times


Prime number - 97 ===> Square root of n to see if there are any divisors for the given number 

Example : 7 

n/2 = 7/2 = < 2.5 

for each values of n from 1 to square root of n --> if it doesnt exist then it is a prime number


Example : 97 


97/2 = 49 

49/2 = 24 

24 /2 = 12 


12/2 = 6 --> Between 6 t0 12 --> divide all the factors to see if it exists..
