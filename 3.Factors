Factors of a given number. 

           10
       1  2   5 10
       
       which is nothing but , it always comes in pairs 1,2 which pairs with 5 , 10 ========> 
       *** even number of factors 
       
       In case of perfect squares then 
       
            16
                 
       1  2 4 8 16  => 5 factors .Odd - only for perfect squares
       
    Based on this condition, to find a given number is prime - all we need is the first half of the factors to see if exists
