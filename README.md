# problem_solving

This repository consists of multiple problems and the appropriate approach to solve these problems.

Tips and Techniques : 
=====================

1. Square root Computation - Log n ( N is divided by N/2 repeately to narrow down the number )
2. Arithmetic progression - n ( n+1) /2
3. Prime number computation - Square root of n and factors rule applies - Hence log n steps are sufficient to find them

Substrings
==========
1. 1234 or abcd === Maximum number of strings possible are (n(n+1))/2
